hello everyone welcome back to the matvid pro AI YouTube channel if you like what you see today please consider subscribing and if you've been watching me for a while why don't you check and see if you are subscribed anyways in yesterday's video we took a look at Windows co-pilot it was one of the many huge and awesome AI announcements but if you guys remember I said it was releasing today and it turns out that it did release today if you have Windows 11 you can go check your updates and when you update you will have copilot which is an AI assistant built inside of Windows 11 ready to use and At Your Service this is kind of like an AI agent that you have inside of your computer at all times you can ask it to help you with certain tasks and to manage files and stuff like that it's some pretty cool stuff we're gonna see how well it actually works it looks like this thing might have future updates as well because it says pre right next to the logo for Microsoft copilot which makes me believe that this thing is kind of in a beta or an alpha stage and it's not really ready for its full potential capabilities anyways I've got some ads that I'm going to play for you that are created by Microsoft to advertise this so it'll just kind of give you a better idea and a better feel for what we're going to be testing today with copilot and how useful this thing could potentially be first up is the general Windows 11 ad by the way I'm replacing the music because for some reason they just always love to use copyrighted music let's check it out [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] so with copilot there are a few things that we can note here as you can see it's built right into your windows that appears right in your taskbar and when you click on it it brings up this little chat gpt-esque Bing text box where you can ask it anything or you can even speak to it and just like Bing chat it seems to be directly powered by those same models that has a creative mode a balanced mode and a precise mode and guys creative mode in Bing chat does use gpt4 so this thing might actually be powered by gpt4 in creative mode so yeah it acts as your general chat GPT guide so you can ask it all the same chat GPT or Bing chat things you can search the web but it could also do things like turn on dark mode for you which Bing chatter chat EPT could never do because they don't have access to the inside of your computer and then there's the other example that they use with Spotify where it actually can open up your Spotify app and play a specific playlist inside of that app so that's very AI agent like is that because Spotify directly integrated with copilot or is it because copilot can just sneakily go in there and it knows how to already adjust the things in your Spotify app that's one we'll definitely have to test out they also have the test here of organizing your windows so you can have a bunch of different opened up Windows messily around and it will apparently move them directly for you which is pretty crazy they also have all of this text stuff like explaining things rewriting things and summarizing things and apparently this works directly with the Microsoft edge browser so we'll have to test that as well and of course it helps you create by drafting with copilot I don't know what app this is exactly inside of this might be a part of the Microsoft 365 stuff which is not out yet and then this was a very crazy example of it just being able to open Adobe Express apparently and create an Instagram reel for you I don't even know how that's possible but I doubt that's that's out yet inside of this anyways either way this all looks pretty awesome and we definitely need to test things so now we'll go ahead and take a look at Microsoft 365 copilot which is separate from the regular Windows 11 co-pilot and this is going to be in all of the Microsoft 365 apps so you'll have to already be paying for it when this releases on November 11th I will put it to the test as well but it isn't out yet let's take a look foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign so again a lot of really awesome and interesting things to note here there will be different plugins two different applications that you will be able to just flip on and off but there's complex things here this looks even more complex than Microsoft Windows 11 co-pilot create a specific ticket for a specific app to track changes outlined in a latest email like this is complex work this is very very much useful the ability to draft replies very simply I like the integration but this is definitely something you can already do just by pasting things into chat GPT you can see though it can actually pull in data from Outlook or any of those other Microsoft 365 apps again uploading doc X Files and presentations at the same time and create an event plan based off of the text provided in those files this is definitely a winning strategy to create this AI focused ecosystem for getting work done I mean this is going to be unstoppable if they can can pull it off we'll have to see how things go on November 11th but this is big news and again it can actually use a word in all of these other programs to create header images for example or to type out for you Apple has nothing even close to this this could really solidify windows in general as the premier productivity platform with just full AI integration Unstoppable truly so if you guys want to look a little bit more into this I'll link the official huge announcement on Microsoft's blog down below again it has all those video clips along with a ton of detailed information and there's a few extra things in there like Microsoft copilot in designer along with Dolly 3 coming to Bing image Creator which I talked about in my previous video essentially this means free Dolly three completely free so that's awesome but like I said I do have access so let's start testing this thing and see just what exactly it can do alright so this is my windows 11 desktop and fun fact I just upgraded to Windows 11 so we'll see how this goes but indeed if we look over here we've got co-pilot in a preview and when we click this little co-pilot button it pops right up on the side just like Bing chat and we've got a few different options here again I'm going to stick to balanced just to start off with this and see it in the most basic mode it has you can actually upload images right from your computer to this thing it looks just like Bing chat up here in more options we've got terms of use privacy statement send feedback learn more in settings let copilot and windows use a Microsoft Edge content sure we'll turn that on might as well open notepad and write me a poem inside of it about lemons sure click submit here every time this thing wants to open an app it has to ask you first so it says can I open the notepad app is that allowed and I like the safety here now I can click yes here or we could respond here just with yes open the notepad and write the poem for me okay off to an interesting start to say the least it responded here by saying oh I've opened the notepad app for you and I've written the uh the poem but no you actually do have to click yes here and make it open it up because well as as far as I'm aware I don't see notepad anywhere in my apps here so yes you do have to click this button here you can't just tell it yeah it's okay to open that let's retry that all right open up notepad for me this time I will click yes in the proper way okay it does open up notepad Okay so it opened up notepad for me which was pretty cool and now it's just writing the poem in a little copy paste box so it looks like it can't interact with notepad yet this leads me to believe maybe they're taking things a little bit slow here it took us all the way there nearly I had to click a little button to copy it and then paste it manually but it made everything as easy as possible I bet this thing does have the ability to paste it directly in notepad for me however I think Microsoft is limiting this thing in certain applications so we'll have to see which applications it actually can use and interact with oh and by the way it can see what is in my copied box and it's asking me if it wants to send whatever I have copy pasted in my clipboard right now all right right here I've got this little funny meme that Dolly three made this was from my Discord Community by the way testing out doll E3 but I'm interested to see if this thing has more advanced image viewing capabilities than typical Bing chat has so we'll plop that right in explain this image to me okay it does seem to be using that same exact Bing chat algorithm our image is a hilarious illustration of a lemon and avocado with speech bubbles lemon is happy and optimistic while the avocado is sad and depressed the joke is based on the contrast between their expressions the lemon is sour but still you know enthusiastic and the avocado is nutritious and delicious but says that they feel empty all right I think that was a pretty good analysis by Bing but it doesn't seem to be using any of those new chat GPT in image viewing capabilities that we saw in yesterday's video oh can you draw an image yeah let's recreate this image I want to see if it has access to Dolly three I'd like to point out that my account thus far has only had access to Dolly 2.5 not Dolly three so I doubt this will work but it's worth a shot yeah okay this does seem to be Dolly 2.5 in Bing image creator with uh just charbeled text all right let's go ahead and try that classic test out of just changing to dark mode would you like to switch to dark mode yes please okay that does work at least so good good news there all right let's go ahead and try something new at this point let's assume that I am new to Windows and I don't really know how to adjust things or fix issues and I'm trying to set up like a YouTube channel and you know what I just I want to just talk to this thing okay copilot I'm having some issues with my new microphone that I just installed and I think that the volume is too low and needs to be adjusted where can I go to up my volume can you help me okay it's off offering to either adjust the volume to 80 or troubleshoot sure I can help you with that you can adjust your audio volume level by using the volume icon on the taskbar or by using the keyboard shortcuts alt it can speak why wasn't this advertised before okay so a few things that's a really nice voice I like that I like that I can talk to it like Cortana the troubleshooter uh I don't think it's gonna help me here because I might just need to adjust the setting so we'll click no thanks to that one but adjusting the volume I have multiple microphones spoiler alert connected to this computer at once so if I just click set to 80 what happens okay it set my speakers to 80 which is not really what we wanted listen co-pilot all that did was set my speaker volume to 80. I actually need to I think change my microphone settings so is there somewhere that I can do that because I don't really see it anywhere opened up settings interesting it didn't even have to ask me to open up the settings this time it took me right into two devices this is a really good place to start now I can see all of my different settings and we'll say like this is the audio device that I'm having issue with all I can do is remove the device here I can't adjust my audio settings so again we'll play dumb and just see if it can take us all the way so I like this settings page you took me to however I can't seem to adjust the sound level by clicking on any of these audio devices is there somewhere I can adjust the sound and settings all right we're running into some of these early development issues like the inability to access your quote-unquote web page at the moment so it isn't able to do anything but act as normal Bing and give me granted very good advice here on how to fix whatever problem I'm having but uh it can't open up that settings page now for some reason it seems like we broke it so I'm gonna have to start a new chat okay copilot I'm about to go into a deep coding session and I need a playlist from my Spotify to really get me in the mood can you help me out oh interesting okay it wants to open Spotify and set a focus session we will click yes to these so what it's done here is essentially pull up my Spotify and then recommend me some famous Spotify playlists and also set up a focus period which I didn't even know this was a feature inside of Windows I think this is pretty cool however it's not what we saw in the ad just now which was you know it actually selecting the playlist for us so maybe that integration just is not there yet because it still is in this preview mode I do like that it has these little five minute breaks in between focusing periods that's pretty cool I might actually use this for studying so let's go ahead and see if it can organize my windows like we also saw in the ad all right so I made some duplicate Windows organize my Windows please Windows snapping okay yes use this feature oh all right it was able to do that as you can see it pulled up everything else though including my voice software and video recorder overall that worked pretty well oh we can can take a screenshot does this work start Snipping Tool open that up for you some apps like it just doesn't need to ask yes take a picture for me oh it took the picture there we go that was easy I I like that okay screenshot worked well there are things I was really hoping it would be able to do like actually use my computer here and search Google for me for example I mean we'll test it out but I don't think it's going to work can you please use the Google window on my actual Chrome application and search format vidpro in there oh okay it can't actually use your Google window or your Chrome application to search for anything I expected a lot more capability from this can it do things like check in see what's on my calendar tomorrow okay it wants to open up the calendar app will allow it to do that oh it looks like I'm not logged into any specific calendar yeah so it just says oh I I've opened up the calendar app for you so you're good to go but really Bing chat could have told me the same thing okay so one last thing that we can try try out that might be really awesome is the ability for it to read information off of Microsoft Edge alright so first thing I've done here is logged into my Twitter account so let's see if it can read my latest tweet from Twitter based off of just having the website open I am currently browsing with Microsoft Edge can you give me some information about the page I'm currently on okay so this might actually be a little bit cooler than you guys first realize typically when one of these little AI agents tries to go out and search a web like chatgpt they do like metadata collection and a lot of websites have blocks put in place to prevent web scrapers such as those so the data can't really be collected that well that's why if you ask Bing how many subscribers I have it's going to give you a pretty outdated answer or just a wrong answer however this is able to give me crystal clear information because I pulled it up myself and I am a trusted and safe user so this is actually very much useful there's been many times when I'm browsing a page with a ton of text and I just want it all summarized so I like to see that alright so let's recap this here I thought it was a little bit too early for this to be released to the public with all that functionality we just saw In Those ads but it seems like it is still in this preview stage it's not out yet fully and quite frankly this is just a buttered up version of regular Bing chat so this is 100 worth following in the future because I mean they gotta fulfill on those promises right especially if they want to take over as the dominant productivity AI based operating system however I have a feeling that those capabilities that we saw those really awesome ones where it can actually interact and use your applications on your computer are coming farther in the future 365 co-pilot which actually looks incredibly useful is going to be coming on November 11th so you bet I'm going to be putting that one to the test as well that should be much more fully formed and very useful let me know what you guys think and what are some future capabilities that you would like to test out with this thing I guess it's worth updating for the convenience of just having a co-pilot but until it becomes more fully fledged and usable I wouldn't bother upgrading from something like Windows 10 if you're already still used to it see you guys in the next one goodbye. YouTube is now ai that's right it isn't just a platform anymore it has evolved into an AI driven ecosystem and in this video I'll explain everything about it but first please make sure to subscribe and activate the notification Bell this way you won't miss any of my upcoming videos now let's dive in YouTube has been with us for over 16 years and has changed significantly during this time initially it was just a site where people posted and watched videos now it's a worldwide platform with countless hours of content ranging from music and entertainment to education and news moreover millions of video creators call YouTube their home producing great content for their viewers and making a living from it for a while YouTube has incorporated AI to recommend videos identify spam and add captions but they're now enhancing their AI efforts by launching new tools powered by this technology these tools will assist creators in various ways from coming up with ideas and editing videos to reaching more people and this will change everything so YouTube announced these new tools at its annual made on YouTube event last week where it showcased some of the coolest and most Innovative things happening on the platform and some of these tools are insane honestly I was blown away by what I saw so let me break them down for you the first tool I'd like to mention is dream screen it's a feature using generative AI that allows people to add AI made video or image backgrounds to their YouTube shorts if you're not familiar YouTube shorts are brief vertical videos similar to tick tock and Instagram reels and they're getting a lot of views these days reaching over 70 billion daily views some people find it tough to make shorts if they don't have the proper gear or setting dream screen helps with this by typing in a background idea the AI can create it for you for instance if you suggest a dragon flying over New York City a dog driving a car or a beach with Jelly Bean sand the AI can craft that background it's a way to get any background you think of with just a description YouTube says that eventually creators will be able to remix and edit their existing content using AI tools to create something new for example you could take a video of yourself dancing and turn it into an animation or a comic book style video there are so many potential applications for this now dream screen is still in an experimental stage right now and it's only available to select creators who are testing it out but YouTube says it will roll it out more broadly next year I can't wait to try it out myself and see what kind of crazy backgrounds I can come up with the next tool I want to talk about is called allowed this is an AI powered dubbing tool that lets creators translate their videos into different languages using synthetic voices this tool is amazing for breaking language barriers and reaching new audiences around the world aloud was originally developed by area 120 Google's in-house incube Invader for experimental projects it uses Advanced speech translation and voice synthesis technology to create high quality dubs for videos it also uses audio separation technology to isolate the original voice from the background sounds and music to use aloud creators just need to upload their video and choose the target language they want to dub in aloud will then transcribe translate and narrate their video using an artificial voice that matches the tone and style of the original voice creators can also review and edit the transcript and translation before publishing their video allow currently supports six languages Spanish from Spain Spanish from the United States Portuguese from Portugal Portuguese from Brazil Hindi and Indonesian and more languages will be added soon YouTube says that aloud is free to use for creators who are part of the YouTube Partner program which is the program that allows creators to monetize their videos with ads YouTube also says that aloud is is compliant with the platform's policies and guidelines and that creators can still earn money from their dubbed videos aloud is already being used by some popular creators such as Mr Beast who has over 180 million subscribers he used aloud to dub some of his videos into Spanish and Portuguese and he gained millions of new views and fans from those regions I think aloud is a game changer for creators who want to expand their reach and grow their Channel without having to learn a new language or hire a professional translator alright the next tool I want to mention is YouTube create it's a fresh mobile app that allows users to edit videos and shorts directly on their phone it's perfect for those who don't have or prefer not to use complicated editing software on their computer YouTube creates simplifies video making you can trim and split your Clips accurately add filters effects Transitions and stickers record voiceovers add sound effects use Auto captions and clean up audio and even find royalty-free music that matches the beat plus you can directly upload your video to YouTube right now YouTube create is being tested on Android in certain countries like the US UK Germany France India Indonesia Korea and Singapore an iOS version will be available next year in my opinion YouTube create is perfect for newcomers or casual video makers it provides all the essential tools for making good videos without a huge investment of time or money it's also a chance to try out various video styles to find what fits your Channel best and the last tool I want to talk about is called AI insights for creators this is a generative AI feature that suggests video topics based on what your audience is watching this tool is meant to help creators with brainstorming ideas and finding new opportunities for growth AI insights for creators works by analyzing your Channel's data and your audience's behavior it then generates a list of potential video topics that are relevant to your Niche and popular among your viewers it also gives you some tips on how to execute those topics such as what keywords to use what format to follow what places to visit etc for example if you're a travel Creator AI insights might suggest you make a video about Portugal's history and culture and recommend some landmarks and attractions you could feature in your video or if you're a gaming Creator AI insights might suggest you make a video about the latest updates and features of your favorite game and give you some tips on how to Showcase them AI insights for creators is currently being tested with select creators who are part of ypp but YouTube says it will launch it in YouTube Studio next year I think AI insights for creators is a useful tool for finding inspiration and staying on top of Trends sometimes it can be hard to come up with new ideas or figure out what your audience wants to see AI insights can help you overcome those challenges and discover new ways to engage your fans so those are the four new AI powered tools that YouTube announced that it's made on YouTube event I think they are all amazing and I can't wait to use them myself I think they will make the creation process easier faster and more fun for everyone but what do you think are you excited about these new tools which one are you most interested in let me know in the comments below if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit the like button subscribe to my channel and click the Bell icon to stay updated on all my future uploads thanks for tuning in and I'll catch you in the next one. today was the metaconnect event and there was some huge announcements at this event the event was really really focused around AI now they talked about AI they talked about the new meta Quest 3 and they also talked about the new smart glasses that they created in collaboration with Ray-Ban now this video is going to be a little bit less polished than usual but I wanted to give you a quick breakdown of all of the cool AI Innovation and talk that came out of this event and then towards the end I'm going to talk about the quest a little bit just for those of you that are interested in that technology as well I do know a lot of people tune into this channel specifically for the AI stuff so if the quest and the mixed reality stuff that I'm going to talk about later doesn't interest you that's why I'm putting it at the end and one thing before I get into it I just want to point out how cool it is that at the front row of this video I can see Colin and Samir my favorite YouTubers as well as a buddy of mine Don Allen Stevenson III who I got to hang out with at the artificial conference last month so really cool to see those people front and center in the audience there let's talk about AI let's talk about AI now they started off the AI portion of this keynote talking about all of the stuff that they've released they this year as well as some of the stuff they've opened Source stuff like their text to speech translation they're image bind their segment anything their audio tools and of course llama too but the first real announcement was when they started talking about their AI image generation tool and we call it emu for expressive media Universe continuing with our Animal theme and here's some of the image Generations they shared like a fairy sloth and a magical forest a fairy cat in a rainbow Forest an astronaut underwater palm trees and a snowy landscape and if dinosaurs were pets and they also claimed that these Generations can be made in just five seconds he then went on to talk about how this new emu model is able to create AI generated stickers inside of chat so platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger anything you can think of you'll be able to create an AI sticker with it for example Hungarian sheepdog driving a 4x4 a capybara with a suitcase a happy Hedgehog on a motorcycle you give it the prompt and it generates the AI sticker for you and then you can use those stickers right inside of tools like WhatsApp in addition to stickers we're also bringing AI editing tools to Instagram next month with the AI image editing tool in Instagram might look like he had a picture of himself as a kid and he was able to put himself into various different outfits he also showed off some examples with his dog where he was able to straighten the hair do a cross stitch pattern and here's his dog as origami later on in the presentation they actually talked a little bit more about how this works and gave some additional examples so check this out we call them backdrop and restyle and they're coming soon to Instagram in the US with restyle you can create a new dimension of visual Flair to your photos by just saying a simple word or phrase you can now re-imagine or create any filter that you can think of if you feel like infusing you know a cozy Vibe you can type crochet or if you want to add a more artistic look you can just type watercolor and restyle makes this really easy with backdrop it leverages one of our most popular model releases from this year segment anything and it can cut out any object in any image with just a single tap so now you can reimagine your background and change the scene with just a few Taps I might type something like surrounded by puppies and this feature will give me an entirely new story for my photo so it looks like Instagram's gonna have some really really cool AI generated effects in the near future that actually leverage metas segment anything functionality they also talked about different AIS for different things they have their main AI which they just call Meta AI this is similar to what you'd expect for something like chat GPT but it's based on their llama 2 model where you can just have conversations with it about whatever you can think of it's also going to be able to generate AI images from directly within the app so for example on the screen they said imagine a sailboat with infinite sales and it drew the image and here they're showing it off in inside of Facebook Messenger inside of WhatsApp and inside of Instagram messenger so pretty much all of meta's various messaging apps this functionality is going to be added into but here's where it gets really interesting they're introducing a whole bunch of sort of Niche chat Bots and they teamed up with celebrities to be the faces of these various chat Bots but they're sort of trained to talk about specific things for example they showed off Max here who is a sous chef who can dish culinary tips and tricks so a specific chat bot for getting help with recipes and meals and things like that and here's Lily your personal editor and writing partner and Lorena the world traveler who would love to help you plan your next trip and then you have Victor played by Dwayne Wade and he's going to pull together a workout plan for you and get you motivated there's Dylan the DIY craft expert and in one of the best moments from the entire presentation we got dungeon master Snoop you can play an interactive game of Dungeons and Dragons Direct directly with this AI Snoop Dogg who hasn't wanted to play a text Adventure game with Snoop Dogg we've got voice coming over the couple of months probably probably early next year or something like that some of the other Niche chat Bots that they talked about rolling out are Bob the robot who's a snarky robot who can help up your academic game you've got Brew played by Tom Brady who's your sports Niche chat bot Naomi Osaka the manga Master Chris Paul is the golf Guru Paris Hilton is apparently the detective Mr Beast plays Zach the funny man I'm not saying I know everything um and we've got Izzy adesanya playing Louise the MMA Maestro Kendall Jenner as Billy the big sis Roy Choi is Max the king of the kitchen Charlie dimilio Coco the dance Queen and of course Snoop Dogg the dungeon master now although they have all of these AI chat Bots designed for specific niches they're also planning on allowing you to train your own that bot based on you so you can train it on your unique interests and expertise so we've been creating something that we call AI Studio it is a platform for building these kind of AIS and we're starting by opening up the API for integrating into our messaging apps to start and that's going to open in the coming weeks we are also building a Sandbox so that you know people who don't code can also train AIS like this and we're working on that and iterating on it and we hope to have that out sometime early next year and we're also working on bringing all of this to the metaverse too where you're going to be able to have these embodied these AIS will be able to be embodied as avatars this is cool um you'll be able to make them as NPCs in the different games and experiences that you build and all this is so wild basically what he's saying is that you're gonna be able to train an AI on yourself that thinks like you talks like you acts like you because it's trained on whatever data you trained it on and then that character could live in the metaverse and people can have conversations with you in the metaverse even when you're not around because AIU will be representing you in the metaverse crazy I think that's gonna be really neat and then he went on to talk about how businesses can use these chat Bots as well train them on their own products and services that way customers can get customer support from the AI chat bot that's trained on your sort of knowledge base from your company which is obviously another huge use case for these fine-tuned custom trained AIS that they're working on then after all of that they got into their collaboration between meta and Ray-Ban to make these smart glasses last thing that I want to show you today which is the next generation of Ray-Ban meta smart glasses now these are designed um so you can stay in the moment and stay connected without having to take your phone out you can capture what's going on around you can share with your friends and the world everything about this is upgraded from the first version so the quick breakdown of these is that they're glasses that you can wear they can be sunglasses they can be prescription glasses they can change out the lens however you want there's really nothing special about the lens themselves there's no like heads up display or anything like that in the lenses although Zuck did say at one point that that is sort of where they're hoping to get these at some point is to have that sort of heads up display inside of the glasses but these ones are really a built-in camera so they have a 12 megapixel camera so you can walk around and record from your point of view they have really good speakers built into them that theoretically really only you should be able to hear because the way the sunglasses wrap around your ear it sort of directs the sound straight to you and ideally nobody around you can hear it now I do know some people that have the last version of the sunglasses and if you are close enough to them you can hear them so it'll be interesting to see if these new ones are improved over that they also announced that with this version you'll be able to live stream directly from the glasses so you can go live on Instagram or Facebook and live stream your perspective on anything so all of that is cool and I'm excited to have that functionality I'm probably gonna get a pair of these Ray-Bans I can see them helping when I'm filming and I'm at events like this to wear these glasses and get little Snippets during the event but here's where the AI comes into play and what makes these quite a bit more exciting than the last iteration of them these are the first smart glasses that are built in shipping with meta AI in them so starting in the US you're going to get this state-of-the-art AI that you can interact with hands-free wherever you go you know let's say you're grilling with your family and you want to know how long you need to be cooking that chicken for you know or you're playing pickleball and hits the line and you want to know if that's a fault or let's say you just want to settle a debate you know some trivia as you're going out through the world just ask your Ray-Ban metaglasses and they'll respond and and get you the answer so that to me is really cool you know right now we've got AI in our pocket you've got the chat GPT app you've got the perplexity app you've got you know whatever chat bot you like to use in your pocket with your phone but now if you have a pair of these glasses you'll just have it right there available to you where in any moment you can just ask it a question and it will respond now he also talked about how there's going to be an update to these glasses in the future so if you buy these glasses in the future you will get this update rolled out into your glasses starting next year we're going to be issuing a free software update to the glasses that makes them multimodal so the glasses are going to be able to understand what you're looking at when you ask them questions so if you want to know what the building is that you're standing in front of or if you want to translate a sign that's in front of you to know what it's saying if you need help fixing this sad leaky faucet you can basically just talk to Med Ai and look at it and it'll walk you through it step by step how to do it the glasses they're launching October 17th you can actually pre-order them now for 2.99 and personally I'm pretty excited about the functionality on these now I'm going to talk about the metaquest 3 in a second here and talk about some of what they announced at that before I do I just kind of want to give some of my thoughts about this event overall I think that this event that meta put on today was sort of a catalyst for mainstream adoption of a lot of this AI technology if you're already using Facebook Messenger or Instagram messenger or Whatsapp all of a sudden you're gonna have ai image generation and AI chat and various Niche chat Bots just available to you in these tools that so much of the world is already using and when it's just there and available you don't have to go to some other third-party website you don't have to go to chatgpt's website you don't need a 20 a month Pro membership for it there's no real roadblocks because it's just in the apps that you're already using I feel like like the adoption of all of this Tech is just going to Skyrocket I also think what meta is doing here with these Ray-Ban glasses is slowly getting the general public to get more and more comfortable with a thought of wearable technology and their end goal is obviously more augmented reality sunglasses at this keynote they did talk about adding heads up display they did talk about these glasses becoming multimodal and actually seeing what you're seeing and understanding what you're seeing to give responses it's only a matter of time before we get augmented reality glasses in this same sort of form factor and I think if a company like meta tried to go too quick and put too much of this stuff in a pair of glasses like this it sort of freaks people out that's kind of what Google Glass did where it just had all this cool Tech in it but they looked Goofy and people were sort of put off by all of the tech that was in these glasses but if they slowly introduce new little pieces of tech into the glass little by little next thing we know these are some of the most advanced pieces of Technology we all have on our body and it just kind of happened gradually that's where I kind of see this going they're sort of training us to get used to this wearable tech and I'm excited about it I have virtual reality goggles I have the mixed reality stuff I'm going to get a pair of these and test them out and see what I think of them and these are just one step closer to everybody having AI at their disposal at any moment yes I can reach into my pocket pull out my phone open one of these other AI apps but with this now I'm starting to get used to just talking to AI whenever I need help with anything without even pulling out my phone basically saying hey meta my glasses fire up I can ask it any question I want it can see what's going on around me to get more context about the question that I'm asking and then it gives me the response our brains are already sort of augmented with the smartphones we have in our pocket we essentially have a second brain where we can get access to any information we want by reaching into our pocket pulling out the phone typing in a query and then looking at the phone to get a response or in some cases you know talking to our phone and getting the response that way this even eliminates one step I know it saves just a few seconds but those few seconds are probably going to make a big impact for how often people actually use this AI technology so when this technology all gets released and we get our hands on it I think it's going to be a pivotal moment for the world of AI and for this wearable mixed reality technology that's starting to roll out at a more rapid Pace we have apple Vision Pro coming next year alright so let's talk about Oculus 3 quickly I'm not going to go too deep into this but it does have some cool features it's not really AI focused but I did want to talk about it because I love mixed reality stuff as well mixed reality allows you to bring digital objects into the physical world now the biggest upgrade to this technology over the metaquest 2 and the metaquest pro is this pass-through technology where you can see your environment around you now that does exist in the metaquest Pro but if you ever tried a metaquest pro it's very pixely and it doesn't look very good it looks like a very low quality video of the room that you're in you don't actually feel immersed in the room that you're literally sitting in you feel like you're watching a sort of pixely video of the room you're sitting in it seems like that's solved with the meta Quest 3 where the environment around you looks much cleaner less pixely and feels more like you're actually still in that environment they showed off examples of people playing games this is like a Lego game that somebody is able to play and that is their actual room around them it's just superimposing the game onto the coffee table same with this there you can actually see the room around the people but it's superimposing the game into the environment that they're actually in it also knows the shape of your room he made a comment about how you can actually throw a digital ball against the wall it will know when it hits the wall and that digital ball will bounce back at you you can be playing a shooter game and you can jump and hide behind your couch and hide from the shots that are firing at you you're gonna be able to watch things like Instagram reels with your environment still around you they'll just see it kind of right in front of your face but you'll still be totally aware of everything that's happening around you you can superimpose pictures and videos on your walls the chip that's in it is the Snapdragon xr2 Gen 2 which is a much upgraded chip over all of the previous meta quests that have come out they've got some new lenses so it's gonna be a lot more high definition a lot easier on the eyes and there's a whole bunch of cool games that are going to be coming out or the quest 3 like this wrath 2 which is a game that actually comes with the quest 3 if you purchase it there's Assassin's Creed Nexus which is an Assassin's Creed game in virtual reality and this was something that I thought was super cool you can basically sit like quartzite at a real live basketball game in virtual reality like you're actually there at the game that to me is really exciting I'm not a huge basketball fan but I definitely want to try that some other cool things that they mentioned about this at the event they're teaming up with Microsoft to make Xbox games available on the metaquest 3 and also the Microsoft Office Suite of tools like Microsoft Word Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint are all going to be available on The Meta quest which really shows that meta and Microsoft really are kind of partnering up on a lot of stuff because as we heard from Microsoft Microsoft is not only working with openai and chat GPT but they're also working with meta in the Llama 2 model but it looks like it's part of their growing partnership now meta is actually going to integrate a lot of Microsoft's tools and gaming platforms into their Hardware as well so that's really interesting to see it feels like meta and Microsoft are almost like teaming up together to sort of take on Google and Apple so there you have it there's my breakdown of metaconnect 2023 some huge AI announcements I think they're going to be some pivotal announcements that are going to push the mainstream adoption of AI forward by Leaps and Bounds push the mainstream adoption of this sort of wearable almost augmented reality technology forward by Leaps and Bounds as well so really really exciting news I know this video is not as polished as my normal videos but there was so much news from meta today that if I try tried to work all of this into my upcoming end of week news video the whole video would probably be dominated by meta so I figured might as well just make a dedicated Standalone video about today's meta announcements that way when I make the news video at the end of this week I can refer you to this video and then just quickly briefly touch on all of meta's announcements in that video so hopefully you enjoyed this hopefully I saved a couple hours out of your life from tuning into the whole event it's still a pretty cool event if you want to watch the whole thing but I pretty much broke down everything they said in this video for you and I tried to do it as quickly as possible so hopefully this was helpful and if you did like this video make sure you give it a thumbs up if you haven't already subscribe to this channel because that makes me feel good and finally check out futuretools.io where I keep the AI news up to date every day I share all the latest cool AI tools that are coming out and I've got a simple twice a week newsletter where once a week I'm going to send you all the latest AI news going on and once a week I'm going to send you all the coolest AI tools that I've come across they're super quick to read emails they come out Wednesdays and Fridays I promise I won't clutter your in box just those two emails a week with the AI news and the AI tools you can find it all over at futuretools.io so thanks once again for tuning into this video hopefully you found it helpful I really really appreciate you the AI world is really ramping up the hype is getting extreme again like it was several months ago I'm excited I've got a lot more videos it's getting back to this point where I can't even put out videos at the pace that I have the ideas for the videos so loving this AI space right now loving the tech space right now and so appreciative that people like you tune into these videos and nerd out with me so thanks again for tuning in appreciate you see in the next video bye thank you. we have a brand new 7 billion parameter model from mistal Ai and that is doing quite a bit good on a lot of benchmarks if you do not know Mr AI there is a very good chance that you might have read this News 4 week old AI startup France from France Mr AI raises $113 million despite no product and little stuff this is a news that came in June 22 20 2023 at the time they did not have a product but today or probably yesterday what they did is they actually released the model on torrent so they actually shared a magnet link and people were wondering what was a magnet link and it turns out that it is a model in fact they have released two different models one is the base mral 7 billion parameter model v.1 and the second one is a mral 7 billion parameter model the instruct model v.1 so these two models come with a very nice very um ambitious announcement I would like to go into the announcement but before that I would like to also point out that this article says that they do not have or they have little stuff but if you go to the model release page you can actually see a lot of good stuffs like at least like I know a couple of names who uh who are quite popular on Twitter at least in the llm space so it seems like they've got good stuff and also their model architecture prioritizes having a faster inference like they have got new techniques like grouped query attention sliding window attention and BP tokenizer that they've used for um for faster inference keeping all this aside if you go to their launch page what it says says bringing open AI models to the frontier I don't know if this is pun intended or it is just like they just wanted to say that bringing open AI models to the frontier it's with the space definitely of course and it's lower case but it's open a anyways why are we building Mr Ai and it goes into the details about how the world has seen all these open-source tools in the past like webkit like Linux operating system like kubernetes that basically you know all these engines run the internet and they have gone into into the details about what is happening in the current world of AI and why generative AI needs open models and as a first step they're releasing the first model which is mral 7 billion parameter model and according to them it outperforms all currently available open models including the Llama 27 billion parameter models in fact they're claiming that in some of the benchmarks it beats even the 13 billion parameter model on coding like English and coding benchmarks before we take their actual result as the face value so the one of the prolific fine cers that I respect a lot is technium so technium managed to run some of the benchmarks so on big bench Mr beat 7 billion parameter Lama 2 but does not beat 13 billion parameter Lama 2 on AG evil it beats Mr 7 billion beat beat the Lama to 7 billion and on truthful QA it actually beats the 7 billion Lama 2 and 13 billion Lama to so even though it is not in every single Benchmark I kind of respect what the company has said and I kind of see that you know they have done something quite good in this model that is the reason why it is performing while people are still trying to figure out why it is doing good so there are rumors that maybe they have used like a lot of data no details about what is the training data that they have used and how far that has helped them so there is no details around how they have beaten all these things and also there is no details around how they're going to justify this money I know this is quite an ambitious thing to say like you know generative AI needs open models but also a company that raised funding needs to make money I mean otherwise nobody will give you money in the first place um that's why I don't get funding for a YouTube channel so on the same line Mr 7 billion parameter models performance demonstrates what small models can do with enough conviction I think this is a statement that I do not take lightly if you have seen the news which I did not cover maybe I'll cover it in the AI news in the week Microsoft is trying to actually build smaller models so Microsoft is in fact focusing on building smaller models that can run easily on either single GPU or on edge devices so if you see all the efforts that have gone into quantization or GG UF model the Lama CPP everything in fact Mark zabak validated this acknowledged this but all these things were like okay what do we do with small models I think a lot of people take this as a joke like when we publish videos people are like hey you just published a 7 billion parameter tutorial why do you want another one I think the world needs lot of smaller models that's what I believe strongly let me know your thoughts in the comment section so mral AI has tracked the small model performance or at least they have tracked any model that has got 60% or above an mm luu and in the last 2 years they're saying from 280 billion goer model then it went to 70 billion chinchila model and then now we have got the 34 billion parameter Lama to model and very new the brand new mral 7 billion parameter model they're saying that they scored more than 60% on MML it's quite a big claim and again like we know at this point that I'm not a big fan of benchmarks to be honest like we would definitely need to try check the model try the model and then see it like I would definitely want to do it not in this video on a different video but the greatest thing the greatest thing about all of this is Mr 7 billion parameter model is released with apachi 2.0 license and making it usable without any restriction anywhere you don't have any kind of restrictions to use this model and they have also opened their GitHub repository for you to go use their code learn some of the techniques like for example they go into the details about what is the sliding window attention that they are using how is it different from vanila attention and how it is going to help you in speeding up the inference process so they go into this detail and if you were to use this model one you can go here into their repository and and then use anything that you want or the easiest option is like if you are a fan of hugging face Transformers you can go here and then use it and like I said they' have released two models one is the instruct model which is the instruction ftuned model and then the second one is the base model the 7 billion parameter model which you can go ahead and then read about it and according to them Mr 7 billion v.1 outperforms Lama to 13 billion on all benchmarks and we just saw some of the examples from technium where it does not do it but either way I'm really looking forward to see how this model performs especially as a matter of fact that the company has raised 113 billion 13 million I said billion 13 million dollar while they have raised $13 million they are also going for open AI models so they want to bring open AI models to the frontier F into de see you another video happy br.
